\begin{abstract}
	This is a set of notes based on the CPEN400Q class offered at UBC
    during the Jan-April 2023 term, taught by Olivia di Matteo.
    It largely follows the slides and demos that can be found 
    \href{https://github.com/glassnotes/CPEN-400Q}{here},
    as well as the reading materials noted at the end of the slides
    (with about one subsection roughly corresponding to one lecture).
    I have also added material I found interesting or insightful from the quizzes/assignments,
    however with any answers omitted.
    The prerequisites for understandng these notes are what I had going into the course:
    a decent background in basic linear algebra and python
    (and probably some calculus, basic computer science, and classical physics),
    pretty similar to \href{https://codebook.xanadu.ai/T.1}{this}.
    It goes without saying that any error here are my own, and if found,
    please email me at \href{mailto:imnichh@gmail.com}{imnichh@gmail.com}.
